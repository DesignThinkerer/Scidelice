# Scidelice

Scidélice is a progressive web application developed as part of my graduation project to obtain my bachelor's degree in computer graphics at the Haute Ecole en Hainaut.

Its goal is to assist users in learning how to cook and plan their meals according to their nutritional needs and preferences. The application provides information on the calories and nutrients of recipes, enables users to create their own recipes, and offers personalized suggestions based on their goals and preferences. Additionally, it includes articles that provide culinary and dietary information. Scidélice is developed using Angular, Ionic, and TiddlyWiki for prototyping purposes.

# Features

- Recipe Database: Scidélice integrates with the Open Food Facts database to retrieve nutritional information for recipes.
- Recipe Creation: Users can create and save their own recipes within the application.
- Personalized Suggestions: The application offers recipe suggestions tailored to the user's goals and preferences.
- Culinary and Dietary Articles: Scidélice includes articles providing information on various culinary and dietary topics.

## Project Structure

This repository contains the source code and documentation for the Scidélice project, organized into the following directories:

- `documentation/`: general documentation files, such as specifications, diagrams, etc.

## Technologies Used

- [Tiddlywiki](https://tiddlywiki.com): Used for prototyping and documentation purposes during the initial stages of development. It provided a convenient way to create a functional prototype and gather feedback before transitioning to Angular and Ionic for the full-fledged development.
- [Angular](https://angular.io): The application is built using the Angular framework, providing a robust and scalable architecture.
- [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/docs?=): Ionic is used for the UI components and mobile app development capabilities.
- [Open Food Facts API](https://openfoodfacts.github.io/api-documentation): Scidélice integrates with the Open Food Facts API to retrieve nutritional information for recipes.
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript: These core web technologies are used for implementing the user interface and application logic.
